Run the pipeline on the OTIS data of the lamp exposure listed in Table
3-2 of the NAP, JOBID = 4791. This is a classic example of using the
already-built superbias and superdark reference files from CRDS for
the NIS readout (there is no matching background exposure as for the
OTIS NISRAPID exposure). All are at ~37 K.

In principle, there is no need to specify the superbias and superdark
to use since the pipeline will automatically grab the correct one from
CRDS. But I do it here to show how these files can be specified
manually.

The _uncal.fits exposure is available in MAST.
